# MemoryCards
The Memory Cards game is a game in which participants must open cards and find paired images. The goal of the game is to find all pairs of cards in the minimum number of attempts.
## How to Play
A set of cards is laid out face down on the table.
The player reveals any two cards. If the images on the cards match, the cards remain open and the player continues their turn. If the images do not match, the cards are flipped back over.
Players take turns until all pairs of cards have been found.
The player with the most pairs of cards at the end of the game is considered the winner.
The game "Memory Cards" is an excellent way to develop attention, memory, and logic, making it popular among both children and adults.
